Traveling is a great way to have an adventure. Moving on from here, I arrived at Georgetown University in Washington DC and immediately became involved in advising and developing data structures for the library archives, learning a lot about Encoded Archival Description (EAD) metadata standards. I also spent a good amount of time helping to enhance the user interface for the library catalog with Javascript. It was during this time I felt like I had a genuine understanding of Javascript and some of the core concepts behind many programming languages. It was exciting to work on a campus with thousands of students and researchers doing important work that depended heavily upon library resources and support for their success. The contributions I made to the online catalog played a small, but at the time an important step in the path of my career.
